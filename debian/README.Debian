libapple-opencl-fft for Debian
------------------------------

This package provides a flavour of the Apple OpenCL example code
implementing the Fast Fourier Transformation as used for the Einstein@Home
projects.

It will take another while, if ever, or this package to find its way to 
the Debian project servers.
